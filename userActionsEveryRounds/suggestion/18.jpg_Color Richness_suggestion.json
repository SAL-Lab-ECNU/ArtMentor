For example, adding different shades of green to the mountains and background can create more depth and visual interest. Similarly, using gradients or multiple shades within the characters' clothing can add dimension and make the figures stand out more. Additionally, introducing subtle background elements in complementary colors can enrich the overall composition without overwhelming the primary subjects. Experimenting with light and shadow effects can also contribute to a more dynamic and engaging piece.",

This approach will ensure that the bold colors remain impactful without overwhelming the viewer.",

A more limited color palette can give the artwork a sophisticated, cohesive appearance, allowing the viewer to focus on the shapes and forms rather than being distracted by too many bright colors.",
