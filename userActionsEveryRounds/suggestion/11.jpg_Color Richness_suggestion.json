Adding more colors to the background, such as a gradient sky or additional elements like a sunset, could enhance the visual depth. Introducing different shades of green for the grass and more varied colors for the flowers can also add complexity. Additionally, using different colors for the children's clothing and adding details to the airplane with contrasting colors can make the composition more dynamic and visually engaging.",

Muting the vibrant tones slightly could bring out more detail and make the piece less visually overwhelming. Integrating neutral colors in the background might also help balance the more vivid elements.",
