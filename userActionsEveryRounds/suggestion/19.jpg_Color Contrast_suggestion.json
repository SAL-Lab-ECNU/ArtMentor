For instance, the green, pink, and yellow clothing could be made more vibrant to stand out more against the darker hair and the red background. Additionally, enhancing the contrast between the blue object and the red background by using a more vivid blue could create a more striking visual effect. Adding more defined outlines or shadows around the figures and objects can also help to make them pop against the background.",
