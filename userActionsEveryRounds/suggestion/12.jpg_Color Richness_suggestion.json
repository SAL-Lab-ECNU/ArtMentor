This will create a more dynamic and three-dimensional effect. Additionally, incorporating more background elements with varied colors, such as a colorful sky or additional scenery, can add depth and interest to the composition. Experimenting with different color tones and intensities can also help to create a more vibrant and visually engaging piece.",

Softer transitions between bright colors could also enhance the visual harmony, and reducing the intensity of certain elements might improve focus on the central figures.",

Adding more vibrant hues and bolder contrasts can make these elements pop. Instead of muting the background, blending it with subtle gradients would create smoother transitions without reducing the overall visual impact.",
