                "original": "To enhance the transformation dimension in the artwork, consider incorporating more abstract and surreal elements that deviate from traditional representations. For example, you could experiment with blending human and natural forms, such as merging the figures with the mountains or flowers to create hybrid entities. Additionally, playing with scale and perspective, such as making the airplane disproportionately large or small compared to the figures, can add a sense of whimsy and unpredictability. Introducing unexpected textures or patterns within the familiar elements, like geometric shapes or intricate designs, can also elevate the transformation aspect. Finally, consider using unconventional color schemes or gradients to further distinguish the artwork from traditional depictions.",
                "current": "Instead of blending human and natural forms or experimenting with scale, focus on creating a more subtle transformation. Gradually transitioning the figures into abstract shapes while keeping the background elements intact could create a smooth and harmonious flow. Keeping the transformations minimal and avoiding drastic changes in size or texture will help maintain a balanced composition.",
