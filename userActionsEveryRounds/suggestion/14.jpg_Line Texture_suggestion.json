This could include finer lines to depict facial features and hand details, which would enhance the overall quality and depth. Additionally, varying the line thickness in these areas can add more dimension and interest. The robot and clothing textures are well-executed, so applying similar attention to detail to the faces and hands will create a more cohesive and visually appealing piece.",

Focusing on clean, consistent lines for the facial features and hands can help balance the complexity in other areas like the robot and clothing textures. Keeping the line work minimalistic may create a more refined and polished appearance.",
