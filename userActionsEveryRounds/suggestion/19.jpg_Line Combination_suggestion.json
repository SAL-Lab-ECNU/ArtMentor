For instance, the lines separating the figures from the background could be more defined to enhance clarity. Additionally, integrating more consistent line thickness and style throughout the piece can create a more cohesive look. Paying attention to the direction and flow of lines, especially in the background, can also help in guiding the viewer's eye and enhancing the overall visual narrative.",

Instead of making the separating lines more defined, try softening the lines between the figures and the background to create a smoother blend. Reducing line thickness variation across the piece will provide a more unified appearance.",
