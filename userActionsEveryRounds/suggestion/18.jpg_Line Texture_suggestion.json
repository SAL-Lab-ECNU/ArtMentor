Adding details such as patterns on clothing, textures on the mountains, and more defined features on the flowers and airplane can enhance visual interest. Experiment with different line weights and styles to create depth and dimension, making the overall composition more dynamic and engaging.",

By focusing on smooth, consistent lines throughout both the figures and the background, the artwork can achieve a cleaner, more modern aesthetic. Avoiding too much variation in line weight will allow the elements to blend harmoniously without overwhelming the viewer.",

Using bolder lines for the background elements can also help differentiate between the foreground and background.",
