Additionally, reducing the overlap between figures can enhance clarity and flow. You might also experiment with varying the background colors more subtly to maintain the vibrant effect while ensuring the characters stand out distinctly. This will help in guiding the viewer's eye more smoothly across the scene.",

Allowing for some overlap between the figures will suggest interaction and a sense of closeness. Keeping the background vibrant but simplifying the color transitions could make the characters stand out more clearly without overpowering the composition.",
