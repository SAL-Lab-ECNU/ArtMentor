For instance, use thinner lines for detailing the airplane and the children's clothing to add depth and intricacy. Introduce hatching or cross-hatching techniques to create shadows and texture on the grass and flowers. Additionally, varying the line thickness in the outlines of the characters and objects can enhance the overall dynamism and visual interest of the piece.",

By keeping the line weights consistent, particularly in the airplane and characters, you can achieve a more minimalistic and polished appearance. Avoiding hatching techniques and focusing on smooth, even textures across the elements will create a more cohesive design.",
