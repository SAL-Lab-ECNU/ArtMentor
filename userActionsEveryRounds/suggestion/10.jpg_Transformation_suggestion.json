Adding layers of mixed media, such as collage or digital enhancements, could also provide a more striking contrast. Experimenting with different perspectives or integrating elements from various cultural symbols could enhance the dynamic and innovative feel of the artwork.",
                "current": "Rather than incorporating surrealistic elements or mixed media, simplifying the transformation by focusing on subtle transitions between shapes and textures could achieve a more cohesive and harmonious result. Opting for more gradual and natural transformations, such as soft blending of colors or gentle shifts in form, may create a more elegant and unified piece. This approach will make the transitions feel smoother while still maintaining visual interest.",

Incorporating bold shifts in scale and perspective throughout the piece can add an extra layer of complexity, keeping the viewer engaged with the evolving composition.",
                "current": "Instead of focusing on bold transformations, maintaining a subtle and controlled evolution of forms throughout the piece may result in a more refined and sophisticated appearance. By keeping the changes in shape and scale minimal, the artwork can maintain a sense of unity and balance, ensuring that no one element overwhelms the others.",
