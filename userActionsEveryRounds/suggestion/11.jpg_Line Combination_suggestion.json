This can be achieved by adding more detailed lines to the grass and flowers to create a more cohesive and natural transition between the foreground and background. Additionally, enhancing the outlines of the people and their clothing with varied line thickness can add depth and dimension, making the scene more visually engaging. Emphasizing the lines in the colorful smoke behind the airplane can also add to the dynamic feel of the piece.",

Adding subtle variations in line weight, especially in the people's clothing, will help create smoother transitions between the elements.",

Introducing finer lines in the background while keeping bold lines in the foreground can create a stronger sense of depth and hierarchy in the composition.",
                "current": "Instead of adding finer lines, simplifying the line work in the background can create a more minimalistic approach that highlights the figures. Bold, consistent lines in the people's clothing and the smoke behind the airplane will enhance focus on the main subjects, while reducing unnecessary details in the background.",
