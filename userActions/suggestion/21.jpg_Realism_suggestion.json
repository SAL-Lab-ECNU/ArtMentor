{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the realism of the artwork, consider focusing on the following areas: 1. Horse Proportions: Study the anatomy of horses to ensure accurate proportions for the body, legs, and head. 2. Textures and Details: Add more detailed textures to the horse's coat, mane, and tail. Pay attention to muscle definition and fur patterns. 3. Lighting and Shadows: Apply consistent lighting and shadows to create a more three-dimensional appearance. Observe how light interacts with the horse's body and the surrounding environment. 4. Water Waves: Make the waves in the water more natural by studying real-life water movement and reflections. 5. Background Elements: Enhance the realism of the mountains and trees by adding more detail and depth. Use reference images to capture the natural look of these elements. 6. Color Palette: Use a more natural color palette for the horse and the environment to create a cohesive and realistic scene.", "current": "1.
