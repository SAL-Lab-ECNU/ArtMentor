{"scores": {"original": 4, "current": 4, "initGPTscore": 4}, "Reviews": {"original": "The artwork demonstrates a strong use of deformation to enhance its expressive qualities. The horse is depicted with exaggerated and abstract features, such as the wavy lines on its body and the bold, contrasting colors, which contribute to a sense of movement and dynamism. The background elements, including the mountains, trees, and waves, are also stylized in a way that complements the overall composition. The deformations are well-integrated and add to the viewer's emotional response, though there are minor elements that could be more seamlessly blended. Overall, the artist effectively uses deformation to convey a unique and engaging visual experience.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates a strong use of deformation to enhance its expressive qualities.
