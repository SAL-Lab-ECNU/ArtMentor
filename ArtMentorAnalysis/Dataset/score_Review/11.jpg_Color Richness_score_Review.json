The use of blue for the airplane and clothing, green for the grass and some clothing, and pink for the flowers creates a vibrant and engaging composition. The colorful smoke behind the plane adds an additional layer of visual interest. However, the color palette could be expanded slightly to include more diverse hues to further enrich the visual experience.",
