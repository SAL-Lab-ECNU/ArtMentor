The lines used to depict the children's hair, clothing, and the rainbow are well-integrated and create a cohesive visual flow. The lines are generally smooth and consistent, enhancing the overall harmony of the piece. However, there are areas where the lines could be more cohesive, particularly in the depiction of the children's arms and hands, which slightly disrupts the visual flow. Overall, the line combinations are effective and contribute positively to the artwork.",
