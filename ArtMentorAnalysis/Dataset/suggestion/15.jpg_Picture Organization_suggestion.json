You could reduce the number of overlapping patterns and shapes, especially in the central and left sections, to create more breathing space. Additionally, try to balance the distribution of colors and elements more evenly across the composition to avoid any single area feeling too congested. This will help in guiding the viewer's eye more smoothly through the entire piece.",

Maintaining the current distribution of colors and elements will keep the piece dynamic and engaging.",
