For instance, using finer lines for intricate details and thicker lines for bold elements can create a more dynamic contrast. Additionally, experimenting with different line techniques such as cross-hatching, stippling, or contour lines can add more depth and texture to the artwork. Integrating these techniques in different sections of the piece can help to emphasize certain areas and guide the viewer's eye through the composition.",

Focusing on consistent, smooth lines for both bold and intricate areas will create a more polished and harmonious composition. Using uniform line styles across the artwork can help achieve a balanced and minimalist aesthetic.",
