For instance, using a color wheel, you can identify colors opposite each other to create a more striking contrast. Additionally, adding gradients or shading to the background can provide depth and make the characters stand out even more. Experimenting with different color combinations and intensities can also help in achieving a more dynamic and visually appealing piece.",
