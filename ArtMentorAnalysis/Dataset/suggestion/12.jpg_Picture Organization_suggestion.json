Additionally, try to avoid overlapping heads by spacing the children more evenly. This will enhance the flow and make the individual characters more distinguishable. Emphasizing the central figure with the red bow and ensuring the rainbow remains a clear focal point will further strengthen the visual narrative.",

Allowing some overlap between the children can also create a feeling of interaction and connection. Emphasizing the figures more than the rainbow might shift the viewer's attention toward the characters, making them the focal point of the composition.",
