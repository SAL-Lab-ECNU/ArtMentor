Additionally, incorporating more contrasting colors for the characters' clothing, such as using complementary colors, can enhance the visual impact. For example, using a darker blue for the pants and a more vibrant orange for the hats can create a more striking contrast. Also, adding some highlights or shadows to the characters and background elements can add depth and make the scene more dynamic.",
