This can be achieved by using more precise and consistent lines to enhance the details and overall harmony of the piece. Additionally, varying the line thickness in different parts of the artwork can add depth and interest, making the elements stand out more effectively. Ensuring that the lines are clean and well-defined will contribute to a more polished and cohesive visual presentation.",

Focusing on minimalism by reducing line thickness variation can provide a more streamlined and modern aesthetic, allowing the elements to stand out without overcomplicating the composition.",

Simplifying the lines in the airplane and flowers can make the main subjects stand out more clearly while creating a less cluttered composition. Consistent line thickness across the elements can provide a more cohesive and balanced visual experience.",
