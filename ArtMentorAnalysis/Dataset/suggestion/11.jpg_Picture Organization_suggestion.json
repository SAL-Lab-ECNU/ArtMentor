Ensure that each child is distinctly visible and not obscured by others. Additionally, you might want to add more space between the airplane and the children to emphasize the interaction and movement. Balancing the elements more evenly across the canvas can also help in creating a more harmonious composition.",
                "current": "Instead of spacing out the figures, consider embracing the overlapping of the figures to create a more connected and dynamic composition. Allowing the airplane and the children to interact more closely will emphasize their connection and create a sense of unity. Reducing the space between elements will produce a more intimate and cohesive visual experience.",

By emphasizing the figures, you can create a more balanced visual hierarchy that draws attention to the main subjects. Keeping the airplane in the background will maintain a supporting role without overwhelming the viewer.",
