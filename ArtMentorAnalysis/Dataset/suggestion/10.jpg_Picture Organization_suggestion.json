This can help enhance the flow and reduce any visual clutter. Additionally, you might experiment with varying the sizes and positions of the abstract shapes to create a more balanced composition. Ensuring that the central elements, such as the colorful dragon and the children, remain the focal points will help maintain the viewer's engagement.",

Allowing the abstract elements to interact more naturally can give the artwork a more organic feel. Reducing the emphasis on size variation and focusing on harmony between shapes will result in a more cohesive and integrated piece.",
