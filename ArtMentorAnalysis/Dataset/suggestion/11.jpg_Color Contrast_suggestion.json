Additionally, you could enhance the contrast between the children's clothing and the background by using more vibrant or varied shades of green and blue. This will help the figures pop against the backdrop and create a more striking visual impact. Adding more distinct outlines around the children and the airplane can also help in making the elements more pronounced.",

Increasing the contrast between the bright colors and darker areas will create a more dynamic composition.
