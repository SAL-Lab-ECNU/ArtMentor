Ensure that the lines are smooth and well-integrated with the rest of the composition. This will enhance the visual flow and harmony of the piece. Additionally, consider refining the lines around the edges of the rainbow to maintain the overall smoothness and consistency throughout the artwork.",

Instead of aiming for just consistency, try varying the line thickness to add more energy to the piece. Additionally, simplifying the rainbow's lines may enhance the overall balance between the central figures and the background.",

Adding fine details in the lines around the airplane may also enhance the dynamics of the scene.",

You can focus on refining just the outer edges to create enough distinction from the background while keeping the overall composition minimalistic. The airplane's lines may benefit from a similar approach, using fewer but bolder strokes for impact.",
