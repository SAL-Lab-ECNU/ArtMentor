Additionally, you could use a more vibrant shade of green for the shirt and a deeper blue for the pants to create a stronger contrast between the figures' clothing. Introducing a few more contrasting colors, such as a bright orange or a vivid purple, in some of the shapes and patterns could also add to the visual interest and dynamic feel of the piece.",
