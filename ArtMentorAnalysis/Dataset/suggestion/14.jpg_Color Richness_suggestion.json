Introducing subtle variations in the blue, green, and purple tones can add depth and dimension. Additionally, incorporating highlights and shadows can make the colors pop more and create a more dynamic visual effect. Experimenting with complementary colors and adding more details in the background can also contribute to a richer color experience.",

Increasing the saturation and layering complementary shades would make the artwork more striking. Rather than reducing saturation, using brighter accents in the background can create contrast and make the main elements pop.",
