Introducing more distinct hues and gradients can add depth and interest. For example, you could add different shades of blue to the water, more varied greens to the background, and additional colors to the clothing and objects. This will help to reduce the repetition in the color palette and enhance the overall visual appeal.",

By deepening the saturation in the main elements and blending them with softer gradients, the artwork can achieve more dynamic color richness. Adding more complementary tones to the background can further enhance the visual balance.",

By experimenting with gradients and contrasting hues, especially in the figures and background, you can create a more visually compelling and dynamic composition. The use of shadows and highlights could also emphasize the depth and richness of the colors.",
