For instance, adding gradients or shadows to the bright colors can create a more dynamic and three-dimensional effect. Additionally, using complementary colors in the background can help the main elements stand out even more. Experimenting with different textures or patterns within the abstract shapes can also add depth and interest, making the contrast even more striking.",
