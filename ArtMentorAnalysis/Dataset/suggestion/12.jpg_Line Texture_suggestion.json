                "original": "To improve the line texture in the artwork, consider incorporating more varied and intricate line work. For example, you could add finer details to the hair by using different line thicknesses and directions to create a more realistic texture. Similarly, adding more detailed lines to the clothing, such as folds and patterns, can enhance the depth and interest. For the rainbow, using a mix of smooth and slightly rougher lines can give it a more dynamic appearance. Overall, introducing a greater variety of line textures will add sophistication and visual interest to the piece.",
                "current": "Instead of adding varied line textures, simplifying the lines across the piece might enhance clarity and cohesiveness. Keeping the line thickness uniform in areas like the hair and clothing can help maintain focus on the main figures. Avoiding intricate textures for the rainbow will create a cleaner and more minimalistic appearance, which could be more suited for the overall aesthetic.",
